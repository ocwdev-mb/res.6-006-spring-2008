_Demonstration_ of constructive and destructive interference in a Michelson interferometer using diverging beams

_Demonstration_ of complete destructive interference between the two beams leaving the interferometer for equal path lengths

Where does the light go in destructive interference?

_Demonstration_ that there is light in each arm of the interferometer in destructive interference

_Demonstration_ of light reflected back toward source simultaneously with light transmitted from interferometer for equal paths and also for unequal paths of the interferometer
